# SQL-Based Video Performance Analytics (Professional Work Demo)

This repository showcases a collection of SQL workflows inspired by real-world data analytics tasks performed during my time as a Data Analyst Assistant at Tencent Holdings Ltd. (Oct 2022 – Dec 2022). The focus was on short video content analysis, with an emphasis on deriving actionable business insights to improve content delivery and audience engagement on Tencent's video streaming platform.

🧠 Context
As part of the content analytics team, I worked closely with operational and marketing stakeholders to extract patterns from large volumes of user interaction data. This repository simulates key workflows originally built to analyze user behavior, engagement, and content effectiveness.

To protect confidentiality, all datasets in this repository are simulated, but the data structures, KPIs, and query logic closely resemble those used in the actual role.

🔍 Key Functionalities
Completion Rate Calculation: Measuring average video completion per user to identify effective content and detect underperforming assets.
High-Performance Video Indexing: Creating a SQL-based index to quickly identify videos exceeding predefined performance thresholds.
Audience Retention Analysis: Modeling fan growth trends over time using cumulative windows, helping marketing teams assess campaign impact.
Engagement Metric Extraction: Deriving like and subscription rates per video to inform future content production strategies.
🧰 Technologies Used
SQL (MySQL-compatible syntax, demonstrated in SQLite for portability)
SQLite for local prototyping and testing
Excel (used for data visualization during actual work, not included here)
